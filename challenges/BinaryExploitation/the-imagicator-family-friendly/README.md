# The Imagicator - Family Friendly

## Description

<small>Author: @Kkevsterrr#7469</small><br><br><br><br> <b> NOTE: this is the <i>original</i> version of the <code>Imagicator - Family Friendly</code> challenge, while the <code>Imagicator - Almost Family Friendly</code> has been created with an update. To keep the consistency of the game we have left this original challenge for those that may attempt to solve it in its original form, but added the second version so that players may attempt it with that update in place.</b> <br><br> Welcome to the Imagicator, the world's most beautiful approach to binary execution. The flag keeps moving around on us, and after public outcry, we've decided to migrate to only allowing family friendly (printable) binaries. But think of how beautiful they'll be! <br> <br> <b>Press the <code>Start</code> button on the top-right to begin this challenge.</b>
