# Darren's Circuit

## Description

<small>Author: @Gary#4657</small><br><br>Darren was doing something fishy with lots of wires.  I was able to snap a picture of the circuit along with the source and output! The output doesn't make much sense to me though.  The ICs from left-to-right are the following: HD74HC157P, SN74HC08N, SN74LS32N, SN74LS86N, SN74LS04N. <br><br> <b>Download the files below.</b> <br><br> Special thank you to <b><a href="https://www.projectcircuitbreaker.com/">Intel: Project Circuit Breaker</a></b> for sponsoring NahamCon EU CTF 2022!
